# Cloud Foundry Redis Service Broker

This repository contains a BOSH release for a Cloud Foundry Redis service
broker.

## Updating

Clone the repository and run `./scripts/update-release`.

## Deploying

Run the `scripts/deploy-release` script. Examples as follows:

```
# Deploying locally to BOSH lite
export BOSH_MANIFEST=manifests/cf-redis-lite.yml
./scripts/deploy-release lite

# Deploying to a different BOSH director
export BOSH_MANIFEST=manifests/cf-custom-redis.yml
./scripts/deploy-release my-bosh-alias
```

Note that the argument is a BOSH alias, which you must have configured prior to running the script. E.G.

```
bosh target https://192.168.50.4:25555 lite
```

## Testing

### Unit Tests

To run the unit tests locally, just run: `bundle exec rake spec:unit`.

You can run it from docker by using `./scripts/from-docker bundle exec rake spec:unit`.

### BOSH Lite
An example manifest for BOSH Lite is provided in `/manifests/cf-redis-lite.yml`

To use this manifest:

1. Update the director guid

```
---
name: cf-redis
director_uuid: REPLACE_WITH_DIRECTOR_ID
```

2. You can increase the count of the `dedicated-vm` plan nodes from the example of `1`

**Note:** If your bosh-lite does not have enough capacity to handle the increased nodes resource requirements, your deployment will likely fail.

```
jobs:
- name: dedicated-node
  templates:
  - name: dedicated-node
    release: cf-redis
  - name: syslog-configurator
    release: cf-redis
  instances: 1
  resource_pool: services-small
  persistent_disk: 4096
  networks:
  - name: services
    static_ips:
    - 10.244.3.54
```
Increase the `instances: 1` to the value you want.
Add an additional static ip to `static_ips:` for every node

You must also add these additional IPs in the properties block at the end of the manifest

```
  redis:
    maxmemory: 262144000
    config_command: config
    save_command: save
    bg_save_command: bgsave
    broker:
      network: services
      dedicated_nodes:
      - 10.244.3.54
```

3. If you want to enable the backup functionality, populate these fields in the properties block at the end of the manifest

```
      backups:
        path:
        access_key_id:
        secret_access_key:
        endpoint_url:
        bucket_name:
```

If these values are not populated, the scheduled backups will not run.


### Properties

Example manifests for BOSH Lite and AWS are provided in `/manifests`. All
required properties are shown in these examples. There are a number of other
optional properties. Descriptions for all properties can be found in the
relevant `spec` files for each job.
